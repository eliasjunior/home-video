## What is it ?

- It's react basic app to list and play videos reading from a streaming API [app](https://github.com/eliasjunior/home-video) 



## Architectural decisions

It's based on the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)  however it's not a pure clean architecture, the goal of this project its to have fun and also to be able to easily evolve the code, replace vendor libraries if we need it to do so, as some smart person once said, patterns are guidance only and we should not go crazy about it, trying to find places in our code to apply it. But it should flows naturally, changing as we need it.

## Understanding it

### File structure

***Divided by feature*** 
The idea it is to easily undersdant what it is, like when you look to a house sketch you know that the picture represents a house.

So this is a front-end app, you know that you will have a footer and header components, home page, a main entrance point and a feature like movie.

The File structure should speak for it self, 

## How to use it

Install the depencies
`npm install`

Run the app
`npm start`

### TODO
